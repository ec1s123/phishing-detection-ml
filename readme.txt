This project uses a labeled dataset of 30+ handcrafted features extracted from website URLs and behavior to classify sites as Phishing or Legitimate. It applies supervised machine learning models to detect phishing threats with a focus on precision, recall, and feature interpretability.

Source: Based on the publicly referenced dataset described in the paper Phishing Websites Features by Mohammad, Thabtah, and McCluskey.
